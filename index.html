        <h3 class="Skilltitle">Designing and building software robots</h3>
        <p>
          Started my career as a test automation developer in eggplant tool. I believe in using open source tools to keep the cost to bame minimum.
         I believe that one of the best uses of technology is to improve human lives by reducing efforts and I am currently in the process of developing robots to achieve the same, maintaining JAVA as the primary language.
